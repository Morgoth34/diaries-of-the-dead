        <h1>Broken Bones</h1>
        <p class="story-text">
          When I was a young girl, my family was extremely poor. We lived in a small shed without electricity or
          running water, on a farmer's farm. In turn for our accommodation my father worked in the fields. We were
          also allowed to plant a few of our own plants. They were our main supply of food. My mother would plant and
          harvest our fruits and vegetables. In her spare time, she knitted clothes for the farmer's wife in turn for
          a small amount of money. Good paying jobs were scarce, especially for uneducated people like my parents. We
          were lucky to have found the farmer and his wife, without them we would have been living on the streets.
          <br />
          I was a lonely child. My parents were so consumed in finding ways to keep my stomach full, that they forgot
          that I needed more than just food and water. I needed their love and attention. I wanted them to spend more
          time talking to me, playing with me or holding me. I never got the type of love that I yearned for, but I
          understood why my parents were always busy. <br />
          I always admired my mother. She was a beautiful woman. Long locks of black hair covered her shoulders. Her
          eyes were as blue as the sky and her skin was as fair as porcelain.
        </p>
        <p class="story-text">
          By the time I was 18 years old, I was the spitting image of my mother. A lot of men would come to our house
          to ask for my hand in marriage, but I would turn them away. I was not going to marry someone whom I did not
          love. If I did, I would condemn myself to eternal loneliness. I had already experienced more than my fair
          share of loneliness, so I waited patiently to find my soulmate. <br />
          We could not afford to buy clothes, thus I was responsible for making them. Every Saturday I went to the
          market in search of fabric. One Saturday morning changed my life forever. I made my way to the fabric shop,
          and I immediately noticed that something was different. I did not see Joseph, the old man who owns the shop,
          selling the fabric. Instead there stood a tall young man with chestnut hair, deep brown eyes and a bright
          white smile. My heartbeat sped up as I got closer to him. He was extremely handsome, definitely the most
          handsome young man I had ever seen. <br />
          "Hi, my name is Daniel. How may I help you today?" he said with a childish grin on his face.<br />
          "I want one of those and two of these," I said pointing to some rolls of fabric.<br />
          "There you go," he said as he handed the fabrics over to me.<br />
          "So, where is Joseph?"<br />
        </p>
        <p class="story-text">
          "He is at home, taking some time off. He is not in good health. I am his grandson, I will be filling in for
          him
          for a while. I hope to see you around here some time again," Daniel said as we stared into each other's
          eyes. <br />
          As I was walking away, I turned back to him and said laughingly, "I guess we will see."
          I could not get Daniel out of my head. I even dreamt of him at night. I wanted to be close to him. I had
          never felt that way about anyone else before, let alone someone who I had just met. <br />
          The next day, I went to the market again and there he was. I went over to his shop, pretending to be looking
          at fabrics. We began to talk and our conversation seemed to be endless. Whenever I was around him, my
          stomach filled with butterflies, my cheeks became red, and my heart could not stop racing. He made me feel
          like I was no longer alone and like I would never have to be lonely again. I was happy when I was with him,
          happier than I had ever been. <br />
          I began going to the market every day just to see him. My parents grew suspicious as this was not my normal
          routine, but they were so preoccupied with their own matters that they didn't give it much thought.
        </p>
        <p class="story-text">
          My friendship with Daniel had blossomed into something much more than just a friendship. I fell in love with
          him and soon I enough I started loving him. We would fantasize of a life together. He told me that one day
          we would build a big house with multiple rooms and huge windows. He promised me that if I began a life with
          him, I would never have to live in a shed or worry about food ever again. He promised me that he would take
          care of me, and I believed him. I believed in him, and I believed in us.

          I told my parents about him, but they were not impressed. "What kind of a life could he give you? His family
          sells fabrics for a living. Do you not want a life better than the one you have now?" my father asked angrily.
          <br />
          "I love him and I do not care about how much money he has," I said.<br />
          "Love is not enough, my dear child. Love cannot buy you a house or put food on your table. Do not be foolish.
          A beautiful woman like you can easily find a wealthy husband!" my mother exclaimed.<br />
          I initially wanted to introduce David to my parents, but after their discouraging words I decided that for
          David's sake, it would be better if I kept them apart.
        </p>
        <p class="story-text">
          A week after I told my parents about David, a man in fancy clothes showed up at our doorstep. He was big and
          tall. His eyes were dark blue and his face was filled with wrinkles. "Mallory, go make some tea for me and our
          guest," my father said. I made the tea as slowly as possible, so that I could listen to their conversation. I
          heard them mentioning my name and negotiating about money. After one cup of tea, the man left and my father
          asked me to take a seat next to him.<br />
          "The man you just saw is Geoffrey Williams. He is a 40-year-old wealthy businessman from a town called
          Saint Mary's, about six hundred miles from here. He asked me for your hand in marriage." my father said.<br />
          "Please tell me that you turned down his offer." I said in a concerned voice.<br />
          "Mallory, you are going to marry that man and live a life of luxury. He has enough money to take care of you
          and of your mother and I." my father said.<br />
          "I will not marry him, I barely know him and I love David!" I yelled angrily.<br />
          "Mallory, this matter is not up for discussion. He will take you home with him tomorrow morning and then you
          will spend the rest of your days as his wife," he said in a strict voice.
        </p>
        <p class="story-text">
          That night, I snuck out of the house to tell David about what my parents had done. "I do not want to lose you.
          If I marry that man, I will never see you again," I said as I laid sobbing in David's arms.<br />
          "I will find you, my love. In this lifetime and in the next. I will not stop," he
          said.<br />
          I spent the night in his arms and woke up around five in the morning. Before I made my way home, I kissed him
          and made him promise to never give up on me and to come rescue me one day.

          ***
        </p>
        <img src="../img/house.jpg" alt="Paris" class="story-image">
        <p class="story-text">
          Geoffrey and I arrived at a huge house with more than one floor and plenty of windows. I was amazed by it, but
          my heart was still filled with sorrow. The house reminded me too much of the one David and I dreamt of
          building together.<br />
          Geoffrey tried to take my hand in his as we made our way to the front door, but I refused to give it to him. I
          saw a darkness in his eyes as his face filled with rage. "You are my wife and you will do what I want you to
          do!" he yelled as he aggressively grabbed my hand.<br />
          At that moment I knew that the house which looked like a dream on the outside, would be a complete nightmare
          on the inside.
          I wanted to write letters to David, but Geoffrey was always watching me. I soon realised that he was a drunk,
          finishing one bottle of whiskey after the other. He often flew into a drunken rage in which he would curse at
          me or hit me. He made me tremble with fear.<br />
          A few days after my arrival at Geoffrey's house, he started insisting on making me pregnant. "What good is a
          wife if she does not give her husband children?" he asked me on a daily basis.<br />
          "I will never bring a child into this world only for him to be raised by a man as despicable as you," I told
          him every day.<br />
          He hit me every time that I said that, but I did not care. I hated him with every fibre of my being and I made
          sure that he knew it.
        </p>
        <p class="story-text">
          At night I dreamt of David. My love for him remained as strong as ever. I kept on hoping that he would come
          find me.
        </p>
        <p class="story-text">
          One night I woke up with a feeling of something heavy crushing my entire body. I began to panic when I
          realised that Geoffrey was on top of me, trying to remove my nightgown. I fought back with all of the strength
          in my body and eventually he got off of me.<br />
          He had an evil grin on his face. "You stupid girl, you will pay for this!" he exclaimed.<br />
          At that moment I knew I had to escape. If I did not escape, he would kill me. My heart was beating out of my
          chest as I ran away from him. I reached the top of the staircase and knew what I had to do. I had to run down
          the steps at full speed until I reach the front door which was right at the bottom of the staircase.
          Afterwards I would make my way to a neighbour's house and ask for their help.<br />
          As I made my way down the steps one of my feet slipped. I collapsed and rolled all the way down to the bottom
          of the steps. I could not move, I had broken my neck. As I laid paralysed on the floor, I saw David's face and
          then everything faded to black…
        </p>

          ***
        </p>
        <p class="story-text">
          Decades later my soul is still trapped in this house of horrors, reminded at every single moment of my sudden
          death. The house is empty and forgotten and so am I. My soul lingers on, waiting for my David to come find me.
          I am condemned to this eternal loneliness, but my spirit cannot pass on. I roam these halls and cry out to him
          each night, for I cannot let him go. I will wait for him in life and in death.
